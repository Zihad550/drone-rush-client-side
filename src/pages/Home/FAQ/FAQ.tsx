      question: "What is a drone?",
      answer:
        "Drones are commonly referred to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAV ) are automated aircraft operating systems operated from a remote location or without direct human control.",

      question: "What is the best drone?",
      answer:
        " DJI is one of the top consumer drone manufacturers, known mainly for their Mavic series . The Mavi series has become the quintessential drone for new to intermediate pilots and videographers and the simultaneous launch in late 2018 of the Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom was huge news in the industry.",

      question: "Is it difficult to fly a drone?",
      answer:
        "There is no doubt that autonomy, especially the ability for a GPS-enabled drone to hover perfectly in place, makes flying extremely easy. In truth, almost anyone can fly the DJI Mavic Pro â€“ tap the button to take off, it hovers with extreme accuracy, then press the button to land almost exactly where you took off.",
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "How long can drones fly for?",
      answer:
        "Small Drones can have anywhere from 700 to 1,300 feet of range. Medium drones can have up to 3.1 miles or 5 kilometres. High-end drones can be programmed with GPS capabilities allowing them to more accurately stay within the set boundaries set by the controller.",
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Can I put a camera on my drone?",
      answer:
        "Buying a drone that comes with support to add your own camera is a great option for photographers and videographers that have a greater concern for the quality of the images and video they intend to capture. Of course, this option does come with its own bag of goodies and bummers.",
